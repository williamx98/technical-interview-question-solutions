# About

I know programming can be challenging so all my solutions are aimed at being simple and readable while preserving an optimized complexity. Feel free to make modifcations and update solutions when you find issues or improvements. 

Optimal solutions, in my opinion, are solutions that can be easily replicated in other languages so there are no fancy Python one-liner solutions. Most of these solutions will run at time and memory complexities better than 100% of the other solutions on LeetCode.

I try to avoid using small functions like min(), max(), and swap() because they abstract out certain foundational programming concepts I feel are important to show off especially to a recruiter or to someone who may not be familiar with Python or any language specific mehthods. I will use min(), max(), and swap() when I see that the solution is already cluttered.
